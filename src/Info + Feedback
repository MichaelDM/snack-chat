FEEDBACK:
in JS always use CamelCase
reducers name: xReducer for file name, then in RootReducer, have x : xReducer
actions name: make files specific to actions category, not index.js. Also, add const right above the functions, not in separate file.js file
components: create a new file for each component, with js and css files
containers: only logic, nothing with JSX
give name to all functions, as it makes it easier to debug
